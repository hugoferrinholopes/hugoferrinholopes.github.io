Thank you for your visit!
======

I am a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). I have been a visiting PhD student at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) and at the Institute of Public Goods and Policies of [CSIC](https://ipp.csic.es/en/about-ipp).

My thesis examines how intra-party divisions relate to political behavior. I study political parties, political representation, elections, and political attitudes and behavior, with a broad interest in the role of youth in politics. My work has been published in <i>West European Politics</i>, <i>International Political Science Review</i>, and the <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>, among others.
