Thank you for your visit!
======

I am a first-gen PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). Currently, I am visiting PhD researcher at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences).

My thesis explores specific mechanisms through which voters and party members perceive intra-party divisions, and how those beliefs translate into political behavior. I leverage original observational and experimental data to examine whether and how different types of intra-party cohesion (or lack thereof) result in electoral damage for political parties and candidates. In addition to my focus on political parties, political representation, elections, and political attitudes and behavior, I have a broad interest in the role of youth in politics. My work has been published, inter alia, in <i>West European Politics</i>, <i>International Political Science Review</i>, and <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>.
