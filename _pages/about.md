Thank you for your visit!
======

I am a first-gen PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). Currently, I am visiting PhD researcher at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences).

My thesis leverages original observational and experimental data to examine how intra-party cohesion (or lack thereof) shape different types political behavior, potentially resulting in losses for political parties and candidates. In addition to my focus on political parties, political representation, elections, and political attitudes and behavior, I have a broad interest in the role of youth in politics. My work has been published, inter alia, in <i>West European Politics</i>, <i>International Political Science Review</i>, and <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>.
