Welcome!
======

I am a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at [ICS, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). Starting September 2025, I will be teaching at [Iscte–IUL](https://www.iscte-iul.pt/) and [EEG-UMinho](https://www.eeg.uminho.pt/pt). Previously, I was a visiting doctoral researcher at the [EUI](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) and [IPP-CSIC](https://ipp.csic.es/en/about-ipp), and have taught at [UBI](https://www.ubi.pt/) and [ULusófona](https://www.ulusofona.pt/).

I study how intra-party divisions shape party strategies and grassroots behavior, and how young people gain access to—and influence—political institutions, particularly through party youth wings.

Methodologically, I design and conduct field and survey experiments with party elites and voters, both as partners and subjects. I am also interested in quasi-experimental methods for causal inference.

My work has been published in the <i>European Journal of Political Research</i>, <i>West European Politics</i>, <i>International Political Science Review</i>, and <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>, among other outlets.

I am currently on the academic job market.
