Welcome to my website!
======

I am a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). From 2023 to 2024, I am at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence as a visiting PhD researcher.

My thesis explores the dynamics of party membership, specifically when and why members choose the loyalty, voice, or exit options, and how parties can preempt future conflicts with their members. The framework I aim to build will shed light on the extent to which these dynamics relate to political ambition and incentives. By leveraging observational panel and experimental data, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of intra-party conflict and party system change.

I am interested in political institutions (particularly, political parties), political representation, elections, political attitudes and behavior and youth in politics. My work has been published, inter alia, in <i>International Political Science Review</i>, <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>, <i>Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research</i> and <i>West European Politics</i>.
