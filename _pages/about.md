Welcome!
======

I am a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). Currently, I am enjoying a research stay at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) (EUI) during the fall of 2024, under the Widening Europe Programme. Prior to this, I was a visiting student at the EUI from October 2023 to March 2024, and at the Institute of Public Goods and Policies of the [Spanish National Research Council](https://ipp.csic.es/en/about-ipp) (IPP-CSIC) in July 2024.

<!-- My research challenges conventional wisdom by investigating how party factionalism can have both negative and positive effects on both party and voter behavior, with a particular emphasis on the role of youth wings as "ideological watchdogs" of parties. I am also interested in how minorities and marginalized groups gain access to political institutions and engage with them â€” especially the youth. 
I use fieldwork and experiments with political elites and party members or voters, either as partners or subjects, to study these topics in Western democracies. 
-->

My thesis explores how intra-party divisions affect political behavior. I study political parties, political representation, elections, and political attitudes and behavior, with a broad interest in the role of youth in politics. My work has been published in <i>West European Politics</i>, <i>International Political Science Review</i>, and the <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>, among others.

I am on the 2024/2025 academic job market.
