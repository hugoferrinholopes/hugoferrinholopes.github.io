Welcome to my website!
======

I am a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). From 2023 to 2024, I am at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence as a visiting PhD researcher.

My thesis delves into the dynamics of party membership, with a specific focus on the circumstances under which members choose to be disloyal to their party or exit to join another instead of voicing their disagreement. Additionally, I investigate how parties can anticipate and prevent future internal conflicts through political incentives and by fueling ambition. By leveraging both observational and experimental data, I aim to contribute to a deeper understanding of intra-party conflict and party system change.

I am interested in political institutions (particularly, political parties), political representation, elections, political attitudes and behavior and youth in politics. My work has been published, inter alia, in <i>International Political Science Review</i>, <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>, <i>Transfer: European Review of Labour and Research</i> and <i>West European Politics</i>.
