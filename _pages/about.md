Thank you for your visit!
======

I am a PhD candidate in Comparative Politics at the [Institute of Social Sciences, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). I have been a visiting PhD student at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) (EUI) in Florence, I will be at the Institute of Public Goods and Policies of the [Spanish National Research Council](https://ipp.csic.es/en/about-ipp) (IPP-CSIC) in Madrid in July, and I am fortunate to have been chosen to return to the EUI between September and December under the Widening Europe Programme.

My thesis leverages observational and experimental data to examine how intra-party cohesion (or lack thereof) relates to political behavior. In addition to my focus on political parties, political representation, elections, and political attitudes and behavior, I have a broad interest in the role of youth in politics. My work has been published, inter alia, in <i>West European Politics</i>, <i>International Political Science Review</i>, and <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>.
