Welcome!
======

I am currently completing my PhD in Comparative Politics at [ICS, University of Lisbon](https://www.ics.ulisboa.pt/). During my doctoral studies, I undertook research stays at the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) and the [Institute of Public Goods and Policies at the Spanish National Research Council](https://ipp.csic.es/en/about-ipp).

My dissertation examines how intra-party divisions can produce both negative and positive effects on party and voter behavior. In a parallel stream of research, I study the pathways through which underrepresented groups, including youth, gain access to and shape political institutions. <!-- representation and the role of youth wings as "ideological watchdogs" within parties. -->

Methodologically, I design, conduct, and analyze cross-sectional surveys and randomized experiments with party members and voters, both as partners and subjects, to study these topics in Western democracies. I am also interested in quasi-experimental methods for causal inference. 

My work has been published in the <i>European Journal of Political Research</i>, <i>West European Politics</i>, and <i>International Political Science Review</i>, among others.

 can have both negative and positive effects on both party and voter behavior I am also interested in how minorities and marginalized groups gain access to political institutions and engage with them â€” especially the youth. 
I use fieldwork and experiments with political elites and party members or voters, either as partners or subjects, to study these topics in Western democracies. 
My thesis explores how intra-party divisions affect political behavior. I study political parties, political representation, elections, and political attitudes and behavior, with a broad interest in the role of youth in politics.

I am on the 2024/2025 academic job market.
